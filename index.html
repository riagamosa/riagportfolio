        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Ria, I'm from the Philippines, moved to Canada back in 2013. It's been over a decade that I've experienced the cold winters, but still dread it yearly. After highschool, I went to post-secondary briefly but did not complete my degree. I had previously gone to University of Calgary taking Visual Studies hopeful to then move forward to Architecture but had a change of interest. I enjoy art and design from a very young age and have always found it interesting. </p>
